        ChatGPT is a form of generative AI - a tool that lets users enter prompts to receive humanlike images, text or videos that are created by AI. ChatGPT is similar to the automated chat services found on customer service websites, as people can ask it questions or request clarification to ChatGPT's replies.

        Bard is a conversational generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Google, based initially on the LaMDA family of large language models (LLMs) and later the PaLM LLM. It was developed as a direct response to the rise of OpenAI's ChatGPT,[3] and was released in a limited capacity in March 2023 to lukewarm responses, before expanding to other countries in May.
